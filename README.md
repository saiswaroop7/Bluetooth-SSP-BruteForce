AN ENHANCED PASSKEY ENTRY PROTOCOL FOR SECURE SIMPLE PAIRING IN BLUETOOTH

In this thesis, we propose a simple enhancement for the passkey entry protocol in the authentication stage 1 of Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) using preexisting cryptographic hash functions and random integer generation present in the protocol. Our research mainly focuses on strengthening the passkey entry protocol and protecting the devices against passive eavesdropping and active Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks in both Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). In addition to increasing the security of the protocol, our proposed model will also significantly reduce the
computation cost and the communication cost of the protocol. This model can be implemented for any Bluetooth device which uses the passkey entry protocol and is of version 4.2 or greater.

We have proposed a new enhanced passkey entry protocol that provides protection against passive eavesdropping and MITM attacks even in case the user reuses the same passkey while significantly decreasing the communication cost and the computation cost making it very efficient. Our protocol also completely prevents an attacker from obtaining the correct passkey by using our brute-force attack. By using our protocol, a legitimate device can successfully prevent an attacker from obtaining the Long term key.
